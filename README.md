RIP JUNOClient repository. I messed something up when connecting another computer to my repo and totally fouled up the project. I was able to save the lates files but kept having problems with the commits after that. Rather than sit and fight it I decided I wasn't that far into the project anyway so I just started a new repo with the latest version files. This repo doesn't show about 5 or 6 commits that represent the starting point of it but I figure it was mostly me doing the initial setup of the gui and the chat which I've dont many times before and probably wont ever need to roll back past that.
